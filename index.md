### Introduction

_Computational complexity is the study of how difficult problems are._ In the same way that physics is not about building better rockets, but understanding the natural principles behind rocket construction, computational complexity is not about building better algorithms! Rather, it’s studying problems _themselves_ as separate, natural entities. [Cite: Nature of comp^2.] Broadly speaking, we assign problems to classes denoted by inscrutable series of capital letters (**P, NP, PSPACE, EXPTIME, BQP**) depending on how quickly the problem becomes stupidly difficult to solve as you try more and more complicated versions of it. That difficulty is given in terms of the resources a computer would have to use. There are more complicated resources (like communicating with other computers) but here we’ll just think about time and space.
